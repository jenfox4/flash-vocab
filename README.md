## About Flash Vocab
As a previous educator, I strongly believe in the ability of technology to level the playing field and tackle education inequity. I wanted to create a full stack app aimed at this mission. I personally have spent countless hours and a lot of money and resources for the GRE. I realized there are few free online resources for the GRE that students can easily access.

This app is meant to be a study tool available for anyone who wants to study the GRE to brush up on rigorous vocabulary. Users can view over 2,000 GRE words and definitions. Users can than create their own personal study stack of flashcards with words they need to specifically study.

## Technologies Used

## The Back-End Development Process
Before beginning, I planned my backend using entity relationship diagrams. I figured out which resources would belong to others. Once I knew what I was creating, I used test-driven development to create resources for the databse. I used heroku to serve my backend.

## To be continued!
I have not yet created validations for the data that can be entered into the database. I definitely want to create validations so that only acceptable questions can be edited.
