###About The Project
As a previous educator, I am passionate about bringing learning experiences to broader audiences through tech. I truly believe tech can level the education playing field. Thus, for this project I wanted to create a full stack app that seeks at helping with one of the biggest education hurdles there is -- tackling standardized test. As someone who both took the GRE and loves learning vocabulary, I had the idea of creating a clean, easily accessibly GRE vocabulary app where users can practice vocabulary words for free and on the go.
