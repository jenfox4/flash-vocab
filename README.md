## About Flash Vocab
As a previous educator, I strongly believe in the ability of technology to level the playing field and tackle education inequity. I wanted to create a full stack app aimed at this mission. I personally have spent countless hours and a lot of money and resources for the GRE. I realized there are few free online resources for the GRE that students can easily access.

This app is meant to be a study tool available for anyone who wants to study the GRE to brush up on rigorous vocabulary. Users can view over 2,000 GRE words and definitions. Users can than create their own personal study stack of flashcards with words they need to specifically study.
